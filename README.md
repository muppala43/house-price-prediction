# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

**Author:** Dillip Muppala  
**Project Type:** Capstone Project – Data Science  
**Goal:** Predict house prices accurately based on 79 features using advanced regression models and provide recommendations to buyers.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict the **sale price of residential homes** using a dataset from Ames, Iowa. It includes complete **EDA, data preprocessing, regression modeling**, and **real-estate buyer suggestions**.

---

## ✅ Key Objectives

- Prepare a complete data analysis report
- Build robust regression models: **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**
- Analyze feature impact on house price
- Give smart suggestions to home buyers based on area, budget, and features
- Compare models and document challenges

---

## 🔍 Skills Used

- Data cleaning & transformation
- Feature engineering & encoding
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning (regression models)
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²
- Feature importance interpretation
- Python programming & visualization

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **XGBoost**

## 📈 Model Performance Summary

| Model              | MAE      | RMSE     | R² Score |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Linear Regression | ...      | ...      | ...      |
| Random Forest     | ...      | ...      | ...      |
| XGBoost           | ✅ Best  | ✅ Best  | ✅ Best  |

> 📌 **XGBoost performed best** and is recommended for production use.

## 📋 Challenges Faced

- Handled missing values (some >80% null)
- Converted categorical features using One-Hot Encoding
- Handled high feature count and ensured no multicollinearity
- Avoided overfitting by comparing models with test split

---

## 💬 Suggestions for Home Buyers

- Buyers with budget < ₹200,000 can target areas like `NAmes`, `OldTown`, `Edwards`
- Ideal houses have 3+ bedrooms, good garage space, and `OverallQual ≥ 6`
- Use neighborhood average price analysis to negotiate better deals
